The older version of the calcio is a dirty game, full of tricks and traps aimed to deceive the other team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps this is the modern Italian football to differ from the football philosophy elsewhere. In calcio is not uncommon to fight the opponent unconventionally, defend, use rugby tackles, even put a player on the ground to steal the ball. One might joke If calcio was official sport today, the former AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gatuso would be great calcio player too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italian style of play is usually associated with having strong emphasis over the defence and cautious playing mentality. Italian teams are alleged to play often defensively their famous catenaccio from the 60s put first. Here is the paradox, while the widespread conception for their foolball among football analysts - it is a clich&eacute; counting on facts which happened more than sixty years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article will try to refute the clich&eacute; with bringing some facts and figures on the surface. In 2010 the head coach of the national team Marcelo Lippi burst during a press conference in England asking a BBC journalist to stop asking questions why they play defensively. Lippi claimed that is tired of listening about this myth from the past. The national team simply can&rsquo;t play as defensively as in the last decades because they don&rsquo;t have the famous and world-class defenders like Facchetti, Baresi and Maldini. Such claims are supported by reality supports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italian clubs had not played the infamous catenaccio for a long time. We can find as many examples as we look for. The national team concedes many goals, same valid for the Italian clubs. One example is Inter Milan, the team most devoted to catenaccio style. In 2011 they eliminated the Bayern Munich with all-out attacking game in both matches. AC Milan and Juventus used score and concede more goals and their games in Europe have becoming a scoring spree. But no one can go above Atalanta in scoring and conceding goals. They play all-out attack. Atalanta&rsquo;s style of play is considered most revolutionary in the last 20 years with no such example of team with so world-class player becoming a sensation in the Italy and the Champions League in the last years. If we have look how the AS Roma and Lazio we would hardly see they ever played defensively. In 2017 Serie A was a first out of four on average goals per game among the top national leagues in Europe with the Premier League finishing last. In season 2019-2020 Serie A finished second on goals per game and leads by good margin this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many would laugh that the famous Manchester United team of Sir Alex Ferguson was a clear example of attacking play. If we take closer look over their games under the last years under Ferguson, we would, might find that they played quite defensive and on counter-attack. Please have in mind the intention here is not to criticize the defensive play of Manchester United and other major English team. All of them are though football opponents and extremely resilient. At the end of the day most collective sport games are won with strong and highly-trained defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion will bring a funny example. Fabio Cappelo is famous for his canonical and pragmatical style as a football coach. He won all titles a coach can win at football club level. While coaching Roma, once they won 5-0 against the visiting team of Venezia. A journalist asked the famous coach in the after-match press conference whether Cappelo is happy with the stunning performance of his team and scoring so many goals. &nbsp;Typically, he replied that prefers five wins with a score 1-0 each. As we said above, Roma hardly ever plays defensive football</p>", "date_posted": "2020-11-19T21:46:42.909Z", "author": 6}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 42, "fields": {"title": "Marcelo Bielsa and his football soul. A story about the man who barely sleeps since 2012", "article_image": "article_pics/bielsa_mFwGuHL.jpg", "content": "<p><em>&ldquo;I am a specialist in failures, but let me tell you that I do know successful people who are not happy in their lives and, conversely, I do know unsuccessful people who are happy in theirs.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcelo Bielsa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Marcelo Bielsa is the best coach in the world,&rdquo; according to the Pep Guardiola. If we look into the acheivements of Bielsa we truly don&rsquo;t find many titles he has won throughout his career. Maybe Guardiola meant that titles are not the milestones for a coach. What matters is the influence on the footballers he has worked with. Recently, Bielsa won much admiration by bringing back Leeds United to the Premier League. He did it without the changing much of players he inherited, but simply made them improve to become better footballers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guardiola and Bielsa met once in 2006 without journalist or video recodings. The former Barcelona midfielder had just called time on his playing career after a spell with the Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa. Aged 35, he decided to become a coach. He remembered back then a piece of advice given to him by a former teammate at Roma, the great Argentinian striker Gabriel Batistuta. &ldquo;Pep, whenever you decide to become a coach, I strongly recommend you to talk to Bielsa &ndash; you will not regret it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great Argentinian striker Gabriel Batistuta. had been coached by Bielsa with the Argentina national team between 1998 and 2002 and even now, when asked about him, he maintains that he was the best coach he ever had. &ldquo;And I had many coaches in my career, you know, but he was the one who really made an impact on me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The encounter between Guardiola and Bielsa has been sufficiently documented, reconstructed in the media since the former became a world-class manager. However, a small detail of that 11-hour meeting in 2006 has remained largely unremarked upon: when Guardiola visited Bielsa at his home on the outskirts of Rosario, the Argentinian was voluntarily unemployed and had been away from football since 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was engaged in finding results in another field at that moment &ndash; he was pursuing happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bielsa had unexpectedly left the Argentina national team after winning gold in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, in the middle of the qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup. He remained frustrated with Argentina&rsquo;s shocking elimination from the 2002 World Cup in the first round. (He still is.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have realised that I have no longer the energy required for the task,&rdquo; Bielsa admitted in a press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is a poor explanation for the papers to put tomorrow in their headlines that the national team coach resigned because he didn&rsquo;t have energy?&rdquo; a journalist inquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;What do you suggest?&rsquo; asked Bielsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, a headline.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you can put, &lsquo;Grave disease makes him have no energy.&rsquo; That would be more effective, yes. I recommend this headline to you. If this were the headline of the paper tomorrow, I would buy it for sure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His frustration and even embarrassment were so unbearable, so intolerable after unexpectedly leaving the national team, that he spent three months locked in a monastery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is a literal truth: ashamed and overwhelmed, still under systematic attack by the sensationalist but also by the serious, well-respected media in Argentina, he hid himself from the spotlight in a convent, lived with nuns and shared their daily routine for three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Bielsa himself recalled, &ldquo;I only brought some books I wanted to read while living at the monastery. I had neither TV nor a mobile phone. I was happy for a moment indeed. But I lasted three months in there because I had started to talk to myself and I felt that I was going crazy locked in there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unhappy though he was at the time, Bielsa, as he would explain later, was seeking an answer in the monastery &ndash; he wanted (and was determined) to discover the key to happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former Argentinian tennis player and 2004 French Open champion, Gast&oacute;n Gaudio, met him in Chile in 2010. There, Bielsa told him that he had already discovered five ways to be happy in life: 1) being a giver, especially with people you do not know; 2) being a believer and a religious man; 3) being in love with your family; 4) probably being successful in your career, and 5) he did not know exactly what this fifth key was, as Gaudio laughingly explained in a radio interview in Buenos Aires, but he was still looking for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em>My family is an unhappy family. And my brother Marcelo is then unhappy. I think that is why we are always seeking for perfection and are ethically inflexible.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Marcelo&rsquo;s brother, Rafael Bielsa, interviewed in November 2019 by Buenos Aires-based paper</em><em>Perfi</em>l<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bielsa was born and raised in a traditional, aristocratic family in Rosario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His grandfather Rafael was a renowned lawyer who rejected an offer to become a judge in the Supreme Court. A street in Rosario and another in Buenos Aires are named after him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcelo&rsquo;s father Rafael Pedro, who died in 2014, was also a well-known lawyer in Rosario. Although he bought Marcelo his first ball when he was a kid, he was not passionate about football. Interviewed by <em>El Gr&aacute;fico</em> in 1998, he even admitted that he had never attended a match involving a team coached by his son. &ldquo;It is because I like football but not modern football &ndash; I liked old football.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His mother Lidia, who died in 2017, was a teacher. When Marcelo was at school, she wanted him to study hard for at least two hours per day after coming home from school. Marcelo already had some unusual habits, like getting dressed in a shirt and tie the night before school and sleeping like that because he didn&rsquo;t like to get dressed in the mornings. But at the same time he had attitudes common in Argentinian children, like the desire to play football in the streets 24 hours a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He therefore masterminded a sophisticated plan. He told his mother that he studied better, more efficiently, when his sister Maria Eugenia played the piano beside him. Music relaxed him and made him more focused and sharp, he explained. When Marcelo was sent upstairs to study, Maria Eugenia, who is now a prominent minister in the Argentinian government, joined him. As long as the piano went on and on, Lidia thought that her son was studying. What she did not know was that Marcelo had sneaked out through the window with a ball and was going to meet his friends and neighbours in the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rafael, Marcelo&rsquo;s brother and the current Argentinian ambassador to Chile, has said about her, &ldquo;She had the sweetness of the 2.0 mothers but also the roughness of the mothers of those times. From her viewpoint, things in life should be achieved by working very hard. That is the only way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No wonder that Rafael asked Marcelo, or simply &lsquo;Marce&rsquo;, on December 2018, &ldquo;Now that you have been there for four months, what about Leeds? Do you like the city?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I have no idea, because I have never been there, but I will someday,&rdquo; Marcelo replied. He had been working very hard, as he had been taught by his mother, without even a glance at the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&rsquo;s no wonder that Bielsa referenced her in the letter he wrote when he accepted the Fair Play Award given to him by Fifa in 2019. &ldquo;I want to mention my mother, who always knew what was right and what was wrong.&rdquo; Bielsa got the award because he had ordered his Leeds players to let their opponents Aston Villa equalise after scoring while an opponent was down injured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His sense of duty is rigid even with smaller, seemingly meaningless details. He has not given exclusive interviews in 20 years but feels that everyone who asks him for an answer should be given one. Like Ignacio Fusco, who is a well-known TV anchorman in Argentina working for <em>TNT Sports</em>. He wrote Bielsa an email once asking him for an interview. Unexpectedly, one night, Bielsa called him, as Fusco told <em>The</em><em>Blizzard</em>. &ldquo;Hello, it is Marcelo Bielsa speaking. I am calling you, Mr Fusco, because I <em>must</em> &ndash; because this is the right way to address a request like yours. However, as I am sure you are aware, I do not give exclusive interviews. I truly hope you understand my decision. I would not like to bother you anymore. Please, Mr Fusco, have a good night.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also during his boyhood that he discovered another thing. Addressed at home as &lsquo;<em>Ni&ntilde;o</em> Marcelo&rsquo; by the maids and living surrounded by books (his grandfather had written 13 books about the law), playing football in the streets with other kids was like discovering another planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There he discovered poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;What do you think about poverty?&rdquo; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One of the five questions Bielsa asked his new players when he joined Lille in 2017 to get to know them better.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first key of happiness discovered by Bielsa, &ldquo;being a giver, especially with the people you do not know&rdquo;, has seemingly guided him throughout his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he joined the Chile national team in 2007, he used to ask the driver hired by the FA, Edgar, to take him to the poorest neighbourhoods in Santiago, like La Pintana or La Legua. As his assistant Gabriel Aravena once recalled in an interview with the Argentinian magazine <em>Don Julio</em>, &ldquo;Marcelo used to come back to the Chilean training camp, where he was living, in a bad mood, devastated about what he had seen in those neighbourhoods. &lsquo;I feel bad,&rsquo; he always told me while going sadly to his room. He seemed in pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He wanted to know everything about poverty and how poor people actually live. It saddened him that there were people with nothing in life, you know, people living like that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bielsa became obsessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driven by Edgar, he started to visit public hospitals and talk with sick people, and to go to poor neighbourhoods and talk with their inhabitants as an anthropologist. He wanted to understand them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He even became worried about the inhabitants of the barrio of Villa El Salitre which surrounds the Chile training camp, a complex called Pinto Duran. While riding his bicycle every morning, he used to ask the people of Villa El Salitre what they needed, if he could be helpful in any way, if they were happy in their lives. Happiness, again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 1998, Bielsa was already worried about happiness in life while coaching the Buenos Aires side V&eacute;lez Sarsfield. He was terrified every time he had to fly and one day he addressed the goalkeeper Jos&eacute; Luis Chilavert during strong turbulence on a flight to Jujuy, in the north of Argentina. He said to him, &ldquo;Listen, Chilavert, may I ask you if you are happy in life?&rdquo; But Chilavert and Bielsa himself were millionaires. They were not poor like the people he spoke to in Villa El Salitre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day Bielsa stopped by a humble fruit and vegetable store owned by a man called Mario Riquelme. He parked his bicycle outside, went in and selected some fruit. When Mario recognised him, he told him that he was very welcome in his store and that he didn&rsquo;t have to pay for anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; replied Bielsa. &ldquo;I do not accept it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took out his wallet and, as Mario wouldn&rsquo;t tell him know how much it was, threw down the notes he had, took the fruit, rushed out, got on his bicycle and rode frenetically to the Chile training camp not realising that Mario was running behind him waving the notes. When Bielsa arrived at the main door of the camp, Mario caught up with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Please, Don Marcelo,&rdquo; a panting Mario said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You are very persistent,&rdquo; Bielsa told him. &ldquo;Well, come in, I will show you the training camp.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Circle of Sports Journalists of Chile recognised him as the best coach in 2009, Bielsa was away in Mexico. But he commissioned a friend of his to be at the gala in order to receive the award. So, when the award was announced, Mario, the owner of the fruit and veg store in Villa El Salitre, received it on behalf of Bielsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mario was a <em>&ldquo;sencillo</em>&rdquo; (an ordinary, simple person), as Bielsa would call him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He admires the <em>sencillos</em>. Like the maids who called him Ni&ntilde;o Marcelo when he was a kid. Or the chefs, cleaners and all the employees at Chile training camp from 2007 and 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Every time Chile won a match, Don Marcelo gave all these employees 100 or 200 dollars from his own pocket,&rdquo; Marcos Muga, the official football federation photographer, has said. &ldquo;He used to go to them himself and paid them. He used to say, &lsquo;Nobody recognises the work of the <em>sencillos</em> but they make their contribution to this&rsquo;. I remember him saying that all the time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once, while working with the Argentinian national team, he was told that an employee of the football association had been burgled. He did not even know him, but he bought several domestic appliances and sent them to this employee&rsquo;s home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was no longer in Chile but in Spain when he was leaving the hotel where Athletic, his team at that time, were waiting for a Copa del Rey match against Oviedo. He was about to get onto the bus when he saw a kid seemingly eager to meet the players. Bielsa went directly to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Young man, young man, come,&rdquo; Bielsa said, according to the Bilbao-based paper <em>El Correo</em>. &ldquo;Come here, come here,&rdquo; he insisted when the kid seemed hesitant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; the kid murmured when Bielsa approached. Athletic&rsquo;s manager took out two tickets and handed them over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told him, &ldquo;Please take these two tickets but these tickets are not for a rich person to enjoy them &ndash;those rich people can buy tickets for themselves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;You are very young and you are premature millionaires. You have no problems, it does not matter to you too much what happens next because everybody has taken care of that. You can allow yourselves to laugh.&rdquo; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bielsa addressing Athletic players after being defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Barcelona in 2012.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Marseille, Bielsa predicted that Benjamin Mendy would become one of the best left-backs in the world. But from his viewpoint, Mendy still needed to understand some tactical concepts. Bielsa prepared some videos for him to explain, but Mendy was largely uninterested, losing concentration after a couple of minutes. Bielsa was seemingly satisfied nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, however, Mendy did not drift off. &ldquo;It was then that Bielsa told me that he needed me to pay attention when I wanted to, that he would not impose on me,&rdquo; Mendy recalled. &ldquo;That is how I learnt what he wanted from me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was not the main lesson he was taught by Bielsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, after a training session, Bielsa told Mendy in front of all his teammates, &ldquo;You can choose to become the best left-back in the world. But by choosing that you would be taking time away from your wife, from your friends, you will be quitting parties and fun. You have a big problem &ndash; very, very big problem. You have a lot of money but you do not have time to enjoy the money you have got and what the money can give you in terms of happiness. I know it because I have seen it many times throughout my career. You would like to buy time with all the money you have. You would pay for time as any person would do if given the chance. So, being successful in your job does not imply at the same time that you are going to be happy. And that is a choice you should make. I want him [Mendy] to know that. But you can choose not to be the best left-back in the world, and what would be the problem with that? There is no problem at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dilemma, after all, is simple in the world of Bielsa &ndash; it is between being the best and unhappy, or not striving so hard, accepting ordinariness and finding happiness.r</p>", "date_posted": "2020-11-20T09:29:56.290Z", "author": 6}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 43, "fields": {"title": "A the foggy mystery of the goalpoasts in Balkans", "article_image": "article_pics/shapelined-qawemGipVPk-unsplash1.jpg", "content": "<p>How&nbsp;Jose&nbsp;Mourinho&nbsp;showed us again he&nbsp;has&nbsp;a&nbsp;magic&nbsp;for&nbsp;every&nbsp;detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am not a goalkeeper but I know football since I was a kid and I know when I stand there and I spread my arms and I know the distance, so I felt immediately that something was going wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story is a tuturial how to spot the incorrect measurement of the goalpost.

Considered one of the best Bulgarian footballers of all time, his path from native Pirin, through CSKA Sofia to Old Trafford was rough with several turnarounds. As a football character he has remained humble about his roots even when wearing the Manchester United jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bulgaria strikes admits his transfer move to Manchester United as a career peak. On arrival, he can&rsquo;t believe that Sir Alex Ferguson himself is waiting him at the airport. We need to acknowledge that by the time of transfer in 2008 he is the most expensive transfer in United&rsquo;s history. Ferguson had an eye for him striker and liked to say when the Bulgarian striker was playing for Tottenham. &ldquo;He is extremely talented, I think even Berbatov himself doesn&rsquo;t realize how good footballer he is&rdquo; - by far this statement from Sir Alex remained valid throughout the entire career of the Bulgarian striker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one looks into Berbatov&rsquo;s football path may find that was rough journey to his arrival at the Manchester Airport. His childhood if full of memories of the reality of a communist economy with queues for bread and any some basic grocery which were scarce deficit back then. A the same time he plays football in asphalt concrete pitch, in fact his recently published a picture doing this as a child in his Instagram profile. On question where did he get the magic first touch, he replied &lsquo;The Brazillians learn their technique and football touch on the sand beaches, I mastered my first touch on the asphalt playing field back home&ldquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When at 16 he is transferred to CSKA Sofia as youngster. One year later is lead goalscorer for the men&rsquo;s team. In his spell there he is under enormous pressure. Berbatov consider to retire from football because of the blaim for lost title after several stunning misses for goal against the arch rival Levski Sofia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transfer to Bayer Leverkusen comes as salvation. His football start rises there and is reaches the 2002 Champions League Final lost to Real Madrid. After Leverkusen comes Tottenham. Between 2002 the Bulgarian striker helps a well-placed in middle-table team to become competitive for the top four teams of English first tier football.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right before signing the contract Berbatov declines a more lucrative offer from Man City. Maybe Ferguson knew this and that is why he took the time to meet him at the airport. In his debut he assists for draw with Liverpool away. The first season is only with 14 goals and near that many assists. With Wayne Rooney as captain the competition within the team is &nbsp;mesmerizing. Man United just won the 2008 Champions League final with Cristiano Ronaldo winning his first Ballon d&rsquo;or. In the 2008-2009 season Berbatov plays a key role in reaching the Champions League final lost to Barcelona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2009-2010 season is the weakest of all spent in Manchester with 12 goals scored. First media critics began and laying for with such great team among world-class players again bring more pressure over Berbatov. Then comes his retirement from international football in summer 2010. A very controversial decision explained which such arguments with fatigue and giving room for the young players. Berbatov is 29 years old at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2010-2011 campaign the strike contributes to the Manchester United title and complements with the top goalscorer prize in the English Premier League. Even this is not enough and Berbatov is surprisingly left out of the entire match group for the 2011 Champions League final where Barcelona trashes the English Champions. Ferguson does not provide convincing arguments for the decision and after retiring as a manager admits it was a mistake. Next season is his last in Manchester with only 12 league appearance scoring 7 goals in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall Berbatov did not adapt fully to the fighting until the end spirit of Fergie&rsquo;s United. All circumstance are agaings the striker as he did not ever was first-team regular but part of the rotating system thanks to the packed schedule. Nevertheless Berbator becomes the first Manchester United player to score a hatttrick against Liverpool, Also set a new league record by scoring 5 goals in one match against Blackburn. &nbsp;All this plus the top goalscorer prize are remarkable achievements considering he never of choice for penalty and free-kick takers in the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many fans still remember is perfectly gallant technique and magic first touch. He was equally ready for goal assist and scoring a goal. A memorable moment is when Berbatov dribbles through West Ham defender with a marvellous move and passed the ball to Ronaldo who scores on the empty goalpost. Instead of congratulating him for the assist, which is unwritten rule in football, the Portuguese footballer show almost no reaction. Berbatov instead walks towards him to congratulate with nobody except him smiling for this goal. This episode sum up his spell of in the legendary team. Manchester United is famous for their fighting spirit and wining at all costs where players are admired for chasing lost balls and fighting to the end. The Bulgarian player was not a runner and good in tackles, did not defend. Unlike Cristiano Ronaldo who had the fighting spirit and professionalism Dimitar Berbatov preferred to play mostly with the enormous talent he possessed. Who knows what he would have been capable of achieving if it had the fighting spirit. In fact maybe he didn&rsquo;t want to realize how good footballer actually he is.</p>", "date_posted": "2020-11-25T09:14:50.863Z", "author": 6}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 49, "fields": {"title": "The spike of injuries in football is caused by the merciless calendar. Football chooses to ignore for now.", "article_image": "article_pics/768x432.jpg", "content": "<p>When Fernando Torres returned to see his friends at Atl&eacute;tico Madrid in Majadonda he noticed something worth paying attention to. One of the kit people was in his early 60s was showing pain in the knee having trouble walking fast. Having literally grown up in Atl&eacute;tico he knew the kit man for thirty years.&nbsp;The two men discussed how the knee is improving and Fernando shared that he is getting near to this condition in the next months. It is a sad consequence of almost 20 years top tier football for the Spanish striker who retired in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could argue that footballers are well-trained athletes and leave the game young to recover from the remorseless game schedule. Playing two game per week is what they are paid after all, and top footballers are paid more than well for their services. Consider playing a professional match on Wednesday night with, travel back with a plane and going for the regular Saturday 12.45 pm game which is scheduled to fill the tv slot which pays for the tv broadcasting rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the injuries record in the Premier League during the Covid-19 season we can see how bad actually get for their health. The situation lead to the Liverpool manager to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Watch_LFC/status/1330641381791031298\">burst in an interview</a>&nbsp;and criticizing the remorselessness schedule in English Football where still the only league in Europe where the five substitutes rules is not adopted. The result is a spike of injuries with Luke Shaw, Trent-Alexander Arnold and Angelo Ogbonna were added to the list of injuries in the entire first-tier football. Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r an Pep Guardiola highlighted the problem too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FA arguments for not approving the five substitute rule is that favours the rich top-table team which possesses long bench with world-class players. Recently so mid-table and bottom table team started to suffer too. In England the national team suffers too with the Nations League schedule and World Cup qualifiers coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebellious behaviour of Klopp is not new as he chose to play the youth team in the FA Cup against top tier clubs. It was just because Liverpool had a game scheduled for the world club cup the next day which had to be played 3500 miles from Enlgland. Actually all he and the majority of the managers are only asking for adopting the five substitute rule which helps to change a player early when the first tweaks, pulls and muscle strains happen during a football game. They cannot change the player when the first minor injury sign happens because they will leave with two more subs. And what happens if another player pulls hamstring in a bit. They simply need to choose who gets injured and not. These facts bring the memories of the 2012 Euro Cup final against Spain where Italy substituted three players until the 60th minute. When Thiago Mota got injured and left the pitch they had the finish the game, a European final that happens once in four years with 10 men who have to run more. Some of them may had small injury waiting to become an big injury that prevents them from playing. Such difference is crucial for the health of footballers. It is important for the fans too with careful watchers noticed that the very same match the Spanish footballer reduced the tempo instead of demolishing the proud Italy team. They still won 4-0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interview Klopp said very wisely that is not a difficult decision. It is difficult for the players who suffer and get injured and the fans can&rsquo;t watch them play. Hte players don&rsquo;t have the say in the discussion. The rest is a decision that needs to be taken in meeting, in an office building, by the people who rejected the five substitutes rule at first place.</p>", "date_posted": "2020-11-25T09:46:10.205Z", "author": 6}}, {"model": "blog.article", "pk": 50, "fields": {"title": "Guardiola vs. Mourinho. The rivalry that never ends", "article_image": "article_pics/rivalry.jpg", "content": "<p>More than ten years ago Guardila and Mourihno clashed as football managers in the 2010 Champions League two leg semi-final between Barcelona and Inter. Their rivalry became more bitter when the latter went to manage Real Madrid. Both have historically special relationship since they worked together in Barcelona in the late 90s under Sir Bobby Robson. The rivalry continued in the Premier League when Mourinho coached Man United and Guardiola build the new Man City team. Now the saga continues after Mourinho returned to manage Tottenham after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked. Under latter the team reached the 2019 UEFA Champions League (UCL) final and become title contenders. Man City visited North London to play Tottenham last Saturday, Nov 21. One might think that the rivalry now continues in sportsmanship spirit so distinctive and respect about the English football culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the game Guardiola<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManCity/status/1329781627837419521\"> tweeted in the official club page</a> praising the work of Mourihno&rsquo;s predecessor and hinting the fact that only last season Tottenham fail to qualify for UCL to the first in last five years. Namely, this season which ended with Mourinho at the helm. Perhaps for it was the reason the Portuguese switched back to more defensive play especially for this match. Since the start of the season Spurs have been playing attacking to entertain the fans with many goals scored. Tottenham went to beat Man City 2-0 and if look at the stats and the gameplay the switch of tactics obvious proved decisive for the winner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this rivalry won&rsquo;t be as direct and passionate as it used to be when both coached in Southern Europe, the recent developments show how it developed into the hidden messages and subtle statements.
